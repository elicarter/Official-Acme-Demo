# Official-Acme-Demo

# This is my demo repo containing the Terraform Configuration files to create a VPC, a subnet, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), two EC2 instances, and necessary security groups. 

# The ELB will distribute incoming traffic to the EC2 instances, and the instances will be accessible via the ELB's DNS name.
